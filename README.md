# Hill Climbing For TSP
 
 The developer has implemented the Hill-Climbing algorithm into the Java Platform. To make the trials fair, the author used the same number of US-based cities. The distance between each city is identified by its latitude and longitudes coordinates. The Haversine formula is used to calculate distances between cities. The Haversine formula calculates the shortest distance between two points on a sphere using their latitudes and longitudes measured along the surface. It is essential for use in navigation.

 In hill-climbing algorithm implementation, the program first generated a distance and based on the result, and it will loop back to previous routes. Then as it connects back, the next course swaps randomly two cities and it loops again for the shortest path. It will stay on the same route for more iteration until it reaches the shortest path. The entire program will end when it reaches 100 iterations as the developer has set the potential maximum. The shortest distance for this algorithm is 6977 miles.
