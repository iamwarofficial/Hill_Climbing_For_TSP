In implementing the hill-climbing algorithm, the program first generated a distance based on the result, and it will loop back to previous routes. Then as it connects back, the next course swaps randomly two cities, and it loops again for the shortest path. It will stay on the same route for more iteration until it reaches the shortest path. The entire program will end when it reaches 100 iterations as the developer has set the potential maximum. The shortest distance for this algorithm is 6977 miles.
